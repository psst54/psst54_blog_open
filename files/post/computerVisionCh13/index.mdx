summary: "Face Recognition"

# Challenges in Face Recognition

- Pose, lighting, expression
- Occlusion
- Aging
- Sketch vs. photo

# Taxonomy of Face Recognition

![Untitled](/post/computerVisionCh13/Untitled.png)

- Appearance-based : entire image = one vector

# Principle Component Analysis

(PCA, Eigenfaces)

face image → feature vector

- The eigenvectors are sorted in order of descending eigenvalues and the **k greatest eigenvectors are chosen to represent face space**.
- This reduces the dimensionality of the image space to k, yet maintains a high level of variance between face images throughout the image subspace.
- Any face image can then be represented as a vector of coefficients, corresponding to the ‘contribution’ of each eigenfac

Eye detection → Face cropping → high-pass filter / low-pass filter

# Face Recognition Vendor Test

FRVT 2006 consists of three input modes

- still images with controlled lighting
- still images with uncontrolled lighting
- 3D images

<Aside>
note

FAR : False Acceptance Rate

- 인식되어서는 안 될 사람이 얼마나 자주 인식되는지

FRR : False Rejection Rate

- 인식되어야 할 사람이 얼마나 자주 인식되지 않는지

# Labeled Faces in the Wild

# Active Appearance Models (AAM)

For each example, extract shape and texture vector

- shape, $x = (x_1, y_1, …, x_n, y_n)^T$
- texture, $g$

AAM model = Linear combination of shape **x** and texture **g**

# Morphable Model (MM)

3D version of AAM

shape x is 3D

# Invariance to Facial Variations

### Video

Video contains rich information (multiple frames, temporal information) that **can provide better face recognition performance**

Challenges

- The same face in a video undergoes substantial **variations in pose,
  illumination**, etc. → frontal face recognition does not work
- Videos captured by surveillance systems cannot be used for subject
  identification because of the **low resolution**

### Aging

Brown Sisters

### Face Marks
